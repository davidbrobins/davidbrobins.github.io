Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) for 2 sections of a sophomore-level modern physics lab in Winter 2024. I assisted the professor with helping groups of 2 students work through each experiment, held weekly office hours for student questions about the data analysis and report components, and (for one section) graded the students' data analysis codes for each lab.
