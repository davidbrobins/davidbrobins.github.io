title: "Exploring the dependence of gas cooling and heating functions on the incident radiation field with Machine Learning"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/ml_chf
excerpt: 'In this paper, we use the machine learning algorithm XGBoost to approximate cooling and heating functions with a general incident radiation field calculated with CLOUDY. We are able to reduce the frequency of large prediction errors compared to interpolation table approaches. We also use feature importance techniques to explore what aspects of the incident radiation field most strongly affect the cooling and heating functions.'
