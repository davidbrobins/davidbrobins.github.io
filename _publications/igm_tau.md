excerpt: 'In this paper, we explore the distribution of Lyman alpha optical depth along simulated quasar sightlines in the Cosmic Reionization on Computers (CROC) simulations. We compare the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of optical depths to observations, subsampling the simulated sightlines appropriately. We quantify the variance in the simulated CDFs due to this subsampling.'
