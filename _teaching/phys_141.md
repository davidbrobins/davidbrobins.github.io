Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) for Physics 141 in Fall 2019 (2 sections) and Winter 2021 (4 sections, virtual). Gave  five-minute introductory lecture on each week's lab, guided groups of 2-3 students through completing the experiment and filling out a lab template (Excel sheets and Jupyter notebooks), and graded each group's completed lab sheets.  In Fall 2019, I also wrote weekly five-minute quizzes with multiple choice and short answers questions on the content of that week's lab manual.
