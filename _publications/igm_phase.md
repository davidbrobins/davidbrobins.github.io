collection: publications
permalink: /publication/igm_phase
excerpt: 'In this paper, we explore the evolution of the phase diagram of low-density gas in the intergalactic medium in four different simulated boxes from the Cosmic Reionization on Computers (CROC) project.  We show that the evolution of the fraction of cold gas is approximately universal across the four different reionization histories, when parameterized by the hydrogen neutral fraction. We also explore the emergence of a tight temperature-density relationship through the decreasing width of the scatter around a power-law relationship. This decrease in width is also a nearly universal function of the neutral fraction.'
