Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) for the honors version of the introductory mechanics course. I graded (approximately) weekly coding assignments and held weekly office hours to discuss these coding assignments as well as auto-graded online numerical and algebraic homework problems, in-class exercises, and prepartion for monthly quizzes and exams.
