title: "Can Cooling and Heating Functions Be Modeled with Homogeneous Radiation Fields?"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/radfieldcooling
excerpt: 'We explore the cooling and heating functions of Epoch of Reionization galaxies from the Cosmic Reionization on Computers (CROC) project. We find that the actual cooling and heating rates of CROC galaxies cannot be adequately described by assuming a spatially homogeneous radiation field.'
