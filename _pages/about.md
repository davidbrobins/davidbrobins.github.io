Hello! Iâ€™m a Ph.D. candidate in physics at the University of Michigan, in the Avestruz Lab for Computational Cosmology and Astrophysics.  I study the behavior and evolution of the baryonic (gas and dust) components of early galaxies using cosmological simulations and machine learning.  

I am also interested in science communication, and am a workshop co-coordinator with Researchers Expanding Lay Audience Teaching and Engagement (RELATE), a Rackham Interdisciplinary Workshop at U-M.

Outside of science, I enjoy playing classical piano and reading a large variety of books.
