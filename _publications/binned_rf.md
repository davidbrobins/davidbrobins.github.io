title: "On the minimum number of radiation field parameters to specify gas cooling and heating functions"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/binned_rf
excerpt: 'In this paper, we modify our previous implementation of XGBoost to approximate atomic gas cooling and heating functions. We now use radiation field intensity averaged in various energy bins to describe the incident radiation field (instead of photoionization rates). We use feature importance tools to find the most important energy bins for predicting cooling and heating functions. We find that a sample of only 3 energy bins (or photoionization rates) are sufficient to accurately interpolate atomic gas cooling and heating functions at fixed metallicity.'
