Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) for the honors version of the third course in the introductory physics sequence, covering special relativity, thermodynamics (with some statistical mechanics), and waves in Fall 2021 and Winter 2022. I led two weekly discussion sections (50 minutes each), where students worked in small groups on worksheets covering problems related to the topics covered in class.  I provided a short introduction to the topics on the worksheet, helped individual groups with questions, and then went over the solutions to the worksheet problems at the end of the section.  I also graded the weekly problem sets, as well as some short-answer questions on weekly quizzes.
