Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) for 4 sections of a virtual, asynchronous half-semester survey course on dark energy, dark matter, and black holes (2 sections each half-semester). I held weekly office hours, and graded student papers (2 page creative assignments on each of the three topics), as well as short-answer questions on quizzes and optional extra credit mathematical problems.
